# Moodify
## By Eric Shull, Scott Fraser, Annie Shin, Rita Bennett-Chew

A student group project for the Epicodus JavaScript course, August 30th 2018. We used Angular API calls, and Firebase for hosting the website.

The concept behind our app was to determine a users mood and play a Spotify Playlist based on that mood and their favorite genre. 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Deployed with Firebase
Visit https://moodify-eb330.firebaseapp.com/ to see the app in action. CORS is necessary for the API call to function, see the Chrome extension [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
